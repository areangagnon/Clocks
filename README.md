# CS-210-Programming-Languages

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   This project had me create two clocks that would display both a 12-hour and 24-hour time. The user inputs their exact time and then the program displays both clocks.
3. What did you do particularly well?
   I'm proud of the functions and conditional expressions that helped serve the purpose of checking the minutes and hours.
5. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   Seperating the functions and main into different files would help make it more readable and efficient. 
7. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
   Within the functions, trying to figure out how to check the time to see if it hits a certain hour, such as 12 to 01, or a second, such as 59 seconds turns into another minute added. I solved this by doing the conditional expressions.
9. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    Any practice that I can get while writing workable code is valuable to me because the more practice I have, the more I learn and better myself. The skills I honed from doing this project will be benficial to me in my career.
11. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I wanted the program to be as readable as possible by maintaining good whitespace and neat functions. I think this program would be very easy to maintain due to it's size and clarity. It could also adapt to changes or influences if needed with certain tweaks.
